# ML-Projects-with-TensorFlow

This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects implemented using TensorFlow. The goal is to provide examples and resources for individuals looking to learn and explore various machine learning concepts and techniques using TensorFlow.

## Projects Included

- **Project 1: [MNIST Number Digit Classifier]**
  - This project demonstrates the creation of a simple neural network using TensorFlow to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. It involves loading and preprocessing the dataset, visualizing sample images, and constructing a fully connected neural network with two hidden layers. The model is trained for 10 epochs using the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical cross-entropy loss. After training, it evaluates the model's performance on test data, providing insights into its accuracy and the predicted labels for the digits. This project serves as an introductory exercise for understanding neural networks and their application in image classification.


- **Project 2: [Stock Predictor (In Progress)]**
  - Training a model to predict Stocks as accurately as possible

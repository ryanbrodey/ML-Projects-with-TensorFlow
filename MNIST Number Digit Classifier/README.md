# Our First Neural Network

This project implements a simple neural network using TensorFlow to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## Overview

In this notebook, we will build a fully connected neural network to classify images of handwritten digits. We will utilize the popular MNIST dataset, which contains 70,000 images of digits (0-9) for training and testing.

This project focuses on teaching a neural network to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. By training on thousands of 
images of digits (0-9), the model learns to identify patterns and accurately predict the number in new images. The project not only 
includes the neural network implementation and training process but also features visualization of the predictions and evaluation of 
the model's performance, making it easy to understand how well the model performs.
